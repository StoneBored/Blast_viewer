## Airblast Overpressure and Ground Vibration Mapping

This repository contains the python script and executable program for visualization and estimation of the overpressure and vibration levels of a single blasting charge.

In order to see the code go to the "CODE" folder and you will be able so the see it with its requirements, in other hand if you just want to run the program just download the entire "Executable program" folder and run the Blastviewer.exe application.  

Once you run the code or the program you will see the main window of the program as follows:

Single Charge main features:
* One blast per time at the center of grid/map (0, 0) by default
* Up to 5 receivers with X and Y coordinates for each receiver
* Decay Level Curve for Pressure or Vibration
* Receivers Level
* Maximum Levels for Annoyance, Human Comfort and Structural damage according to Australian Standard AS2187.2
* Colored grid/map with pressure or vibration levels
* You can choose between Pa or dB for pressure, PPV or dBV for vibration.
* Save the graph or/and map.
